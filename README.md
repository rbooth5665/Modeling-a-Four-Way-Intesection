# Modeling-a-Four-Way-Intesection
Semester project for CS4632, showing a model for a 4 way intersection with varying congestion levels. Aims to answer the question "how can we best manage congestion throughout the day" through the simulation of traffic, including different variables like car size and speed, as well as accident occurances.
